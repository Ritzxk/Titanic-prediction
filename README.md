  - Streamlit
  - matplotlib
  - sklearn
  - machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Decision tree, SVM, Random forest)
 
## Task
To develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a person survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, pclass, family_size, embarked, and fare, you can follow these steps:

**Data Preprocessing:**
Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for 'embarked').

**Feature Engineering:**
Create a new feature for family size by combining relevant columns ('SibSp' and 'Parch').Explore and analyze the data to understand its distribution and relationships between features.

**Split Data:**
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

**Model Selection:**
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) for binary classification (survived or not survived).

**Model Training:**
Train the selected machine learning model using the training dataset and the features mentioned (age, pclass, family_size, embarked, fare) as predictors.

**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to determine its effectiveness in predicting survival.
